# Meiosis-Modeling

This project analyzes and implements a minimal model of the **meiosis process in budding yeast**, a type of cell division essential for sexual reproduction. We use simulations in Python with interactive visualizations created using **Bokeh** and **Panel**.

> It is **strongly recommended** to run the code in a **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment** to fully interact with the plots.

The plotting and modeling style is inspired by [Caltech's Bi/BE 150 course](http://be150.caltech.edu/2020/content/lessons/00_setting_up_python_computing_environment.html).
